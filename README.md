This Unity scene features a game of life being played out on a cube. As the cube moves around the scene, it interacts with speakers in the world that individually offer up new music; as the music changes so does the game of life and its colors o particle emmisions.

There is no user interaction; simply press play and enjoy the work the team put into making this a cool scene.

-Warner Schiebe: Scene, sound design
-Simon Katzer: Line, particle system, some audio work, provided the starter code for colorful cellular automata
-Kameron Fincher: Cellular automata mechanics, including spawning cells in response to the music
